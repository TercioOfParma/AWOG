Hello, welcome to the awog modding tutorial, it is easier to do shit in this than in other 
games so look at the below and you will see what to do:

first line, that number:

This number tells the game how many items are in the file, so you need to change it when you
have finished modding. Use notepad++ to code as it tells you the line number, which is 
important as the last line in the file with a monster on it is the number you put at the
top

eg weapons.txt 
5
sword of derp;5;
Axe;5;
sword;7;
cheese;6;

there are 4 items and the first line thus the number is 5

new monsters

it is easy to create a new monster, you do it like this

level;Monster name;hp;attack;successfull attack verb;failure verb;xp dropped;

You really should organise this in order as the next version will relie on the order

new weapon:

weapon name;attack;

new armour:

armour name;armour;


new consumable:

potion name;xp;hp;attack;
